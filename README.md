#How to run the program
	
- swicth to the repo directory.
- `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 5000`
	- run a localhost with port **5000** (this is the port I configured in **Foursquare**)
- visit `localhost:5000` in your brower



#Library, API, Framework I use
- Vue.js (simple MVO)
- Jquery (do ajax stuff)
- Google Map
- Foursqure (get extra info)
- Bootstrap (simple UI)


#Things to know

- I use **Vue.js** as the MVO framework (I think getting familiar with Vue may be more helpful for my latter job hunting, compared to Knockout)
